NORTHRIDGE TAUGHT A LESSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ School has been out at Cal State Northridge since
the week before Christmas, but since you can learn something every
day, Mississippi State's women's basketball team gave a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has talked about taking its game to the next level.
The 21st-ranked Bulldogs _ the first nationally ranked team to play
here in Northridge's Division I era _ gave a glimpse of that level
in a 98-64 nonconference victory before a crowd of 165 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It ended CSUN's 16-game home win streak.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Matadors learned from the Bulldogs (10-0) remains to
be seen. The Big Sky Conference season begins Thursday at Northern
Arizona, but the Matadors don't believe they'll face anyone of this
caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conference isn't that strong,'' Edneisha Curry admitted,
``so we have to play hard and play with the type of desire and
heart night in and night out, so we can play with Mississippi State
and all the other ranked teams.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they have completed the most difficult portion of the
schedule with two losses to nationally ranked teams in Illinois and
Mississippi State and a win over an NCAA Tournament team in
Dartmouth. It leaves them 6-4, the same record they had at this
time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they weren't talking about elevating their game at
this time last year. Since the Matadors have reached the NCAA
Tournament and are hungry for more, Mississippi State provided
clues to what they need to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's the basics: shoot a high percentage, rebound well and
commit fewer turnovers and fouls. Shooting 36.7 percent, taking
just 28 boards and committing 17 turnovers might be enough to win
the Big Sky, but it won't get you past Mississippi State, which
shot 50.7 percent and took 51 rebounds. Although the Bulldogs
turned over the ball the same number of times, they also committed
six fewer fouls.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to have a player like freshman LaToya Thomas, who
can deliver points in bunches when needed. Thomas scored 33,
including 18 in the first half, but was most valuable in the second
half when she scored eight points in a 10-0 run that ended any hope
of a Northridge comeback. CSUN had cut a 50-25 halftime deficit to
59-45 with 12:21 to play and had some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in the second half was to cut it to 10 by the
10-minute mark,'' CSUN coach Frozena Jerro said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Northridge has a Thomas-like player in Curry, who
scored 21 points. But she made 9 of 23 field-goal attempts, far
below Thomas' 11 of 18.
</P>
<P>
   The other time Northridge was close was when it scored eight
straight points and trailed 13-12 with 12:46 to play in the first
half. Mississippi State responded with a 25-7 run in 9:10 to put
the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're getting a lot of experience,'' Bulldogs
coach Sharon Faning said. ``They need to work on footwork, defense,
rebounding _ same as us.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other Mississippi State players scored in double figures:
Jennifer Fambrough (22), Cynthia Hall (11) and Meadow Overstreet
(11). Northridge got 14 from Lynda Amari and 13 from LaShaunda
Fowler.

A CORRECTION: WELCOME TO 51,254 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For those who believe that in the good old days _
before calculators, before computers _ people were better at mental
arithmetic, The New York Times offers a sobering New Year's
message: Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, 1898, it seems, someone preparing the next day's
front page tried to add 1 to the issue number in the upper left
corner (14,499) and came up with 15,000. Apparently no one noticed,
because the 500-issue error persisted until Friday (No. 51,753).
Saturday The Times turns back the clock to correct the sequence:
this issue is No. 51,254.
</P>
<P>
   Thus an article on March 14, 1995, celebrating the arrival of
No. 50,000 was 500 days premature. It should have appeared on July
26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The error came to light recently when Aaron Donovan, a news
assistant, became curious about the numbering, which he updates
nightly when working at the news desk. He wondered about the
potential for self-perpetuating error. Using a spreadsheet program,
he calculated the number of days since The Times' founding, on
Sept. 18, 1851.
</P>
<P>
   Through the newspaper's archives, he learned that in its first
500 weeks, The Times published no Sunday issue. Then, for 2,296
weeks from April 1861 to April 1905, the Sunday issue was treated
as an extension of the Saturday paper, bearing its number. In the
early days, the paper skipped publication on a few holidays. No
issues were published for 88 days during a strike in 1978. (During
five earlier labor disputes, unpublished issues were assigned
numbers, sometimes because catch-up editions were later produced
for the archives.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, by scanning books of historic front pages and reels of
microfilm, Donovan zeroed in on the date of the 500-issue gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that appeals to me about the way the issue
number marks the passage of time across decades and centuries,''
said a memo from Donovan, who is 24. ``It has been steadily
climbing for longer than anyone who has ever glanced at it has been
alive. The 19th-century newsboy hawking papers in a snowy Union
Square is in some minute way bound by the issue number to the
Seattle advertising executive reading the paper with her feet
propped up on the desk.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other number on the front page _ the volume, in Roman
numerals _ it remains CXLIX. It will change to CL on Sept. 18, when
The Times enters its 150th year.

 BC- Y2K-MALL-2NDLD-COX &HT;    MASSIVE CROWD WATCHES CLINTON IGNITE FIREWORKS SPECTACULAR TO
GREET 2000
 &HT;    EDS: New top and updates throughout.
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clear skies and a string of flawless midnight New
Year's rollovers around the globe enticed a massive crowd to the
National Mall for a fireworks spectacular ignited by President
Clinton to greet the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when Clinton called on America to make its ``dreams
stronger than its memories,'' 2000 arrived in the nation's capital
in a shower of light over the Washington Monument that left
thousands of spectators cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with
the Great Emancipator peering over his should, said ``Americans
must not fear change. Instead,'' he said, ``let us welcome it,
embrace it, and create it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although daytime activities in Washington drew modest crowds,
throngs streamed in by nightfall to find grassy seats on the
heavily-secured patch of the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   They choked into long thick lines through a handful of security
checkpoints where revelers submitted to searches. At one point,
crowds on 17th Street waiting to pass through security entrances
pushed over barriers and rushed past police who were helpless to
stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, officials had been scaling back the size of the
crowd they expected from an original estimate of 500,000. But as
midnight closed in, the streets teemed with people and there seemed
to be little left of the anxiety over terrorist attacks that
prompted the mayor of Seattle last week to cancel a major outdoor
celebration around the city's famed Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's three-hour show, with a pricetag of $12 million,
competed on television with the customary Times Square celebration.
While New York's gala featured the traditional ball of light
descending in the seconds before midnight, Washington's had a white
light of fireworks cascading up the 555-foot Washington Monument,
sparked by a fuse racing along the reflecting pool from the Lincoln
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Tresca and her husband, Sal, of Rhode Island, left the
friends they were visiting in a Maryland suburb to come down to the
Mall where the gala at the Lincoln Memorial also was shown on large
screen TVs set up on the grass. Their friends wouldn't leave their
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're too busy holding onto their bottled water,'' Diane
Tresca said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she wasn't concerned about terrorism. ``No,'' she said,
``I'm more concerned about not being able to see the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at events throughout the day, Clinton made no mention
of the unease that had settled on Washington in the weeks leading
up to Friday night. Fear of terrorism pegged to year-end
celebrations focused on Washington, New York and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we celebrate did not begin today, and it will not end
tomorrow,'' Clinton said to a crowd at the Mall earlier in the day.
``There is no better opportunity to open a new chapter of progress
and possibility for all people ... no better time to be a truly
good neighbor to the people of the world who share this smaller and
smaller planet of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked God ``for this wonderful weather, so we all feel
good being out here. . . The sun is still rising on America.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sunlight faded on the day, the Siegel family of Richmond
played the card game Uno while sitting on the curb waiting, with a
few hundred others, to be let into a fenced off section of the Mall
nearest the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Actor and musician Will Smith hosted the three-hour stage show
called ``America's Millennium Gala.'' Clinton and other
dignitaries, including former Sen. John Glenn, watched from a
heated booth at the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Among the performers were actors Robert Duvall and Jack
Nicholson, actress Diane Keaton, and musicians Don McLean, Bobby
McFerrin, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Kathy Mattea, Trisha
Yearwood, and the 25-member company of the Broadway production
``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Siegels weren't worried about the dangers of either Y2K
chaos or terrorism. In fact, they joked about the festivities being
hosted by Smith, who has played the hero in a pair of futuristic
space-themed films, ``Men in Black'' and ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought since Will Smith is the host and he's killed aliens
and space bugs, you couldn't be in a better-protected zone,'' joked
Dan Siegel, 46, who was there with his wife, Peggy, and children
Julia, 16, and Tommy, 14.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for danger made it possible to get a hotel
room within walking distance of the Mall just last week. And, in
their one concession to the Y2K bug, the Siegels settled on
Washington as their New Year's celebration destination because they
could make the trip from Richmond and back on a single tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in case there's a problem and we can't get any more,''
said Peggy Siegel, also 46.
</P>
<P>
   For Benjamin McKenzie, 29, the trip to the Mall was just a walk.
He lives on Capitol Hill and brought his 15-year-old brother, who's
visiting from upstate New York, down for the fireworks. But he
couldn't get his friends to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said 'No way!''' McKenzie said. ``We know security is a
concern, but it's not overwhelming. It feels like a normal day.''

FEAR OF COMPUTER GLITCH GROUNDS THOUSANDS OF AIR TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (UPDATES 2nd graf with midnight arriving; ADDS graf 4 grafs from
end of story about glitch) (kd) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airports around the world, ordinarily quiet on New Year's Eve,
were unusually so Friday as thousands of potential travelers stayed
put while the world's air traffic system rolled over to the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite such fears and recent concerns about terrorism,
commercial aviation entered the new year without incident as
midnight arrived around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The major test for commercial aviation came at midnight in
London when the global air traffic control system, which observes
Greenwich Mean Time, crossed over into the new year without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, about 1,350 commercial jets were in the air at the
time, according to the Air Transport Association, the airline
industry's trade group. That was less than half the number of
planes that flew last New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines around the world canceled thousands of flights because
of low demand.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol, the organization that coordinates air traffic over
Europe, estimated that about 50 jets were in the air at midnight, 5
percent of the peak traffic on a typical winter day.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines and American Airlines, the world's two largest
carriers, said they had canceled about one-third of their flights
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, airports across the United States appeared
desolate. The three New York airports _ Kennedy International,
LaGuardia and Newark _ were expecting to handle only 270,000
passengers Friday, compared with 430,000 on the same day last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many airline executives and aviation officials around the world
had hoped to reassure the public by being passengers themselves on
New Year's Eve. Jane Garvey, chief of the Federal Aviation
Administration, booked herself on several flights that were
subsequently canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, flanked by the head of the FAA's Year 2000
effort, two public affairs officers, Sen. Slade Gorton of
Washington and a score of journalists, she boarded an American
Airlines flight from Washington to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 empty seats available on the jetliner, the only
passenger not directly connected to Ms. Garvey's efforts appeared
to be Janet S. Rhodes of Long Beach, Calif., who said she came to
Washington on Friday so that she could greet the new millennium
aloft and tell her grandchildren about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhodes said she had told her four sons, ``Just follow Jane
Garvey's progress on television and you'll know where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's airlines and air traffic control centers spent an
estimated $2.5 billion to assure that their computers could read
the year 2000 correctly. But experts did not consider air safety to
be particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The only glitch reported Fridayoccurred when printers in Alaska,
California and Long Island that are used to relay information to
control- lers from airplanes flying over the ocean all went on the
blink at mid- night Greenwich time. The failure lasted only about
30 minutes and had no operational effect, the FAA said, adding that
it was not even clear that the problem was caused by the date
change.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co., the world's largest producer of commercial
airliners, said it surveyed thousands of airborne systems on its
planes and found only three that were date sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many passengers said they were not taking any
chances by being in the air at the witching hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will probably be OK, but I'm trying to get home
before midnight,'' said Del Turner, who was waiting for a flight at
Los Angeles International Airport. ``Something will happen. They
haven't fixed everything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Hubbard, a television producer and broadcasting executive
and a pioneer in the medium, died on Dec. 27 in Kenwood, Calif. He
was 75 and had been suffering from Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard was vice president for programming and production at
Post-Newsweek Stations in Washington, the broadcast group of The
Washington Post, from 1969 to 1976. Before that he was the national
programming manager and executive producer of public affairs for
Group W, the Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. in New York, where he
helped to develop the Steve Allen, Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin and
Regis Philbin shows and ``P.M. East'' with Mike Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   At Westinghouse, Hubbard was responsible for programs including
``Discovery,'' a 13-part series on contemporary art produced with
the San Francisco Museum of Art; ``Black Culture,'' 65 half-hour
programs created with Morgan State University in Baltimore; and
``Children's Spectaculars,'' a series of hourlong dramatic shows
featuring Zero Mostel, Boris Karloff, Claire Bloom and others. He
also produced a variety of specials, including the Benny Goodman
show at the American pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   An advocate of educational children's fare, Hubbard worked with
local school systems and hired writers to create study guides, one
of the earliest examples of the interactive use of television in
learning. He was responsible for ``Harambee,'' the first daily
scheduled black culture-oriented program on American television,
and ``Everywoman,'' the first prime-time women's program.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retiring from Post-Newsweek, Hubbard produced ``Special
Delivery,'' five half-hour programs for children about living with
disabilities. He then established Unicorn Projects Inc., a
nonprofit production company.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard was the recipient of major broadcasting awards including
the Emmy, Dupont and George Foster Peabody Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Los Angeles, he graduated from the California College of
Arts and Crafts in Oakland in 1942 and earned a master's degree in
theater and communications from Stanford University in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marion; three sons, Bruce and
Stephen, of Pasadena, Calif., and Gregory of Wells, Maine; and two
grandchildren.

 &HT;    THIRD MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS CAST LIGHT ON TWO MEXICOS
 &HT;    By FRANC CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Special to the Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAXACA CITY, Mexico _ While most of Mexico welcomed the Third
Millennium with fireworks, concerts and long-standing traditions,
the celebration was muted in rural areas by fear of rebel attacks
and the so-called Y2K bug's negative impact on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   All across Mexico and here, in this well-known colonial city,
families joined together for traditional New Year's Eve supper and
counted down to mid-night wearing red underwear, which they believe
brings them good luck in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to three different stores today looking for red
underwear,'' said Marta Ramales. ``But all the stores were out and
I couldn't find it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   She opted for a red blouse and toasted the new millennium with
glass of strong mescal, Oaxaca's answer to tequila.
</P>
<P>
   After the toast, each of her 20 family members ate 12 grapes
each, one for every month. The tradition comes from Spain, where
the fruit is eaten also to bring good luck in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the celebrations, small business owners said Y2K began
with a drop off in tourism among international travelers,
especially from the United States. Many blamed it on fears of
possible Y2K computer troubles. For example, Mexico City airport
officials said 40 percent of flights on Dec. 31 were cancelled due
to ``mostly last-minute cancellations'' over Y2K concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, young Mexican boys here in Oaxaca City celebrated the new
millennium as they do any New Year's Eve, by tossing firecrackers
in the fiesta-filled streets. And the city planned massive
fireworks display that would take place over the colonial-era
cathedral in the city center.
</P>
<P>
   An even more festive atmosphere prevailed in streets of the
capital Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The historic Paseo de la Reforma, the city's main boulevard, was
filled with tens of thousands of revelers, coming to see parades
and live concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral bells rang in the main square, called the Zocalo,
where 300,000 people turned out for shows by Mexico's famous singer
Juan Gabriel and to hear 200 mariachis sing Las Golondrinas, a
traditional song that says good-bye to the old year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the millennium fervor, President Ernesto Zedillo, in a
video-taped address, said, ``We are a country that does not measure
our history in months or years, but in
</P>
<P>
   millenniums.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexican capital, there was little talk of Y2K computer
glitches following months of claims by government officials that
Mexico is among the most Y2K-compliant nations in the hemisphere.
It has installed computer programs to prevent banking errors, and
to keep the national stock market _ the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores _
from crashing on the new year's first day of business.
</P>
<P>
   A larger concern for the government is the threat of armed
guerillas of the Popular Revolutionary Army, or EPR, in the
mountain villages of the Sierra Madre del Sur in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed soldiers could be seen watching over villages near
Oaxaca City, thought to be rebel strongholds and stopping vehicles
at military checkpoints on the highways outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the government is bringing troops to indigenous
villages to stop the rebels,'' said Pedro Nava Rodriguez, director
of the Organization of Towns and Neighborhoods in Guerrero. ``But
they are violating the human rights of innocent people who have
nothing to do with guerilla struggles.''

   Two thousand years after Christ's obscure birth in a dusty town
in Judea, the world's 6 billion people _ most of them non-Christian
and many of them preoccupied with terrorism, computers, diets, bank
accounts, politics and the perils of the future _ rode their
turning blue planet across time's invisible line Friday and, by
common consent, looked into the dawn of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw first was a party. It was garish, glittering and
global, and millions, setting religious considerations and personal
concerns aside, joined in the festivities to celebrate the
conjunction of a new year, a new century and a new thousand-year
cycle of history. They also put aside the inconvenient fact that
the millennium, technically, is still a year off.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly mattered. In New York's Times Square and across the
United States, in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, in cities and
towns all over the world, bells pealed, crowds shrieked and surged,
skyrockets soared into the night, fireworks burst into supernovas,
``Auld Lang Syne'' rang out, lights pulsed, loved ones and friends
embraced, and the music and Champagne flowed.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when moods ran the spectrum from tensions and prayers
to euphoria and irresistible hyperbole, what most were calling
Christianity's Third Millennium arrived in 24 stages as the earth
revolved through the time zones and midnight elapsed again and
again in an around-the-clock, around-the-world series of golden
moments that began at the International Dateline in the Pacific and
raced westward across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a vast crowd of revelers _ the guesses ran as high
2 million _ packed Times Square and much of Midtown Manhattan for
the biggest public event ever held in the city _ a 26-hour, $7
million marathon of music, fireworks, confetti and deafening voices
culminating as a 1,070-pound crystal ball descended at midnight,
while the police sweated out an enormous potential for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And there were lavish celebrations in Washington, London, Paris,
Rome, Berlin, Jerusalem, Moscow, Cape Town, New Delhi, Shanghai,
Beijing, Tokyo, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and
hundreds of other cities. There were parties, concerts, dances,
torchlight parades and televised extravaganzas that brought the
worldwide show to billions more at home and to the crowds in Times
Square over giant video screens _ a case of celebrators watching
celebrators.

   To a Martian earthwatcher (tuning in with delicate ear and
Cycloptic eye), it might have appeared that the inhabitants of the
third world from the Sun had suddenly lost their senses or gone to
war again. But it was only humanity on the threshold of a new age,
exercising its primal urge to celebrate.

   There had been an avalanche of happy millennial overkill in
recent days _ claims of the last-game, last-meal, first-baby kind _
and Friday it was the turn of world leaders in government,
religion, science and other fields, who spoke of the millennium's
meaning in more serious tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we celebrate more than the changing of the calendar,''
President Clinton, extending millennium greetings to the world,
said in an address to diplomats and children from 100 nations. ``We
celebrate the opportunity we have to make this a true changing of
the times, a gateway to greater peace and freedom, to prosperity
and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Boris Yeltsin, who has been plagued with heart and
other problems for most of his eight years as Russia's president,
unexpectedly announced his resignation. ``Russia must enter the new
millennium with new politicians, new faces, new intelligent, strong
and energetic people,'' he said. ``And we who have been in power
for many years must go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II, fulfilling his dream to lead
the Roman Catholic Church across the threshold of 2000, gave his
blessing to a vast crowd in St. Peter's Square, reiterated his
calls for an end to war and poverty, and thanked God for ``the
events of this year, this century and this millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   There were millions around the world who had no reason to be
festive, people like Tom Nganga, 40, who lives in Kangemi, a vast
slum of Nairobi, Kenya. ``We as Kenyans and people of Kangemi are
very, very angry as we celebrate this millennium,'' he said.
``People are very poor. People have nothing to eat. We have nothing
to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   While the millennium celebrations drew millions, there were
relatively few casualties. In the Philippines, two people were
killed by stray gunfire and a 5-year-old boy died after a
firecracker exploded in his face. At least 200 other Filipinos were
injured by fireworks. In Paris, 70 people were hurt in crowds.
</P>
<P>
   After years of concern over Y2K computer problems that had cost
billions of dollars to fix, there were no immediate reports of
computer-related disasters anywhere in the world _ no plane
crashes, major power failures, nuclear plant shutdowns or collapses
of banking, business, government or health care systems.
</P>
<P>
   But elevators, intercity trains and subways in many American
cities and in other countries as well were halted briefly over the
witching hour, and some airlines canceled flights for the day, just
to be safe. Many airports were all but deserted, with wary
travelers staying put. Experts said it might take days for some
computer problems to develop, in part because many businesses and
government agencies were closed for the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been fears that terrorists, publicity seekers or
the insane might set off explosions or mount chemical or biological
attacks as millions gathered to celebrate, while vast audiences
watched on television. No specific threats had been reported,
although some suspects had been seized recently. Still, there were
no immediate reports of trouble, and law enforcement authorities
seemed ready for almost anything.

   The millennium, an idea with overtones ranging from Biblical to
commercial, had swelled recently into a coercive miniculture as the
countdown ticked away and a flood of books, articles, television
specials and studied commentaries by academic, political and
religious leaders reflected upon the last thousand years of human
achievements and missteps, and speculated on the next thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Purists still insist that the millennium will not start until
Jan. 1, 2001, and they are no doubt right. The calendar, at best,
is arbitrary. There were problems from ancient times based on
inaccuracies in measuring the year's duration and its uneven
division into days, weeks and months. By 1582, the spring equinox
was 10 days early, and the days were dropped when the Gregorian
Calendar replaced the old Julian version. While Pope Gregory's
calendar uses the birth of Christ in 1 B.C., as a starting date,
many scholars now suggest that the year was probably closer to 4
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, as Voltaire noted, history is the lie that
historians agree upon, and the tide of popular opinion has swept
nearly everyone along. And with the climax of celebrations, and
especially when the nines rolled into zeros at midnight and
humanity went ballistic, purists' talk of technicalities was the
last thing anyone wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   For doomsayers who had prophecied conflagrations, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions and other end-of-the-world scenarios (and kept a
weather eye out for UFO rescue ships), the new millennium was
something of a nonevent, although the anxiety prompted by all the
wild predictions of chaos was real enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Revelations, Chapter 20, speaks of a resurrection of
the dead and a judgment day, of sinners cast into a lake of fire
and Christ reigning for a thousand years. But if it was not the
Second Coming of Jesus as foretold in the Bible, there was still a
year to go, or this was the wrong millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And if, as some said, even the idea of a Third Christian
Millennium was a Western conceit in a world where Christians are a
minority, and one that overlooked other calendars calling this 1420
(Muslim) or 5760 (Jewish), it was also true that the world had long
ago come by economic and social necessity to agree upon the Western
calendar for trade, travel and other common purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium, if nothing else, was a celebration of history,
marking human survival after a deadly century of wars, genocide and
revolution that saw the end of colonialism, fascism and communism,
as well as the achievements of the past thousand years _ printing
and widespread literacy; the exploration of the last frontiers on
earth; the first ventures into outer space, the inner mind and the
microscopic universe, and the flowering of democratic government,
and of art, literature, science, technology and communications into
undreamed eminences.
</P>
<P>
   The world on this Millennium Day was still beset with terrible
problems _ with grinding poverty that afflicted a third of its 6
billion inhabitants, with ethnic and national strife, with the
continuing curse of racial and religious bigotries, and with the
exclusion of countless millions from adequate health care,
education, jobs and even such basic needs as shelter and clean
water, not to mention freedoms of speech and political association.
</P>
<P>
   But with a few exceptions _ notably threats of terrorism and
limited wars in the Balkans, Chechnya and other regions _ it was a
world largely at peace, with the apocalyptic threat of nuclear
annihilation receding and new understandings growing between old
enemies in the Middle East, Ireland, South Africa and other
long-troubled areas.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a world on the threshold of a new era _ one that
offered visions of astounding strides in science and technology and
seemed to hold out anew the ancient promises of universal peace and
prosperity, although the only certainty seemed to be that the world
a thousand years from now would be unrecognizable.

   As Dec. 31, 1999, gave way to Jan. 1, 2000, in each time zone at
midnight, with atomic clocks marking it to a millisecond,
celebrants went ecstatic. It began in Fiji and the Kiribati and
Marshall Islands in the Western Pacific (it was 7 a.m., EST Friday)
and moved westward, hour by hour, as the earth turned and 23 more
midnights fell across Australia, Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas
and back across the Pacific, ending in Samoa at 6 a.m., EST
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders in Kiribati welcomed the millennium with the mournful
sounds of a conch shell and with traditional chants and dancing on
the beach of a normally uninhabited coral atoll, dubbed Millennium
Island.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, which has absorbed many of the trappings of the
Western world while preserving its own cultural and religious
traditions, bells tolled in a Buddhist ritual to dispel evils as
thousands flocked to temples and shrines. In Tokyo, the first of
the world's major cities to mark the new year, people went to
parties and crowds swarmed to bayside events, including rock
concerts and lavish fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   In China, torchbearers in Imperial-era costumes lighted signal
fires on the watch towers of the Great Wall, which snakes 3,000
miles from the Gobi Desert to the North China Sea, and President
Jiang Zemin lighted an eternal flame to greet the new millennium
and pledged a ``great rejuvenation'' by reuniting with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Over Hong Kong Harbor there were brilliant fireworks displays,
and parties abounded, a prelude to the Chinese new year, the Year
of the Dragon, which starts Feb. 5.

   The festivities for most of India's 1 billion people were muted
by comparison with those in wealthier nations, but hundreds of
thousands danced, drank and ate at open-air stalls in New Delhi and
partygoers were out in force in other major cities, celebrating the
peaceful end of an eight-day hostage crisis aboard an Indian
Airlines hours before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Iran and its Persian Gulf neighbors largely ignored the new
millennium, which fell during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a
time for prayer and reflection.
</P>
<P>
   With religious bans on celebrations that might desecrate holy
days, the celebrations in Israel were relatively subdued. In
Palestinian-governed Bethlehem, the town revered by Christians as
the birthplace of Jesus, 2,000 doves were released at midnight on
Manger Square, and in secular Tel Aviv thousands just went to the
beach to watch the sun set over the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Security was heavy in Israel as three religions and some
doomsday cultists marked the occasion, each in its own way. It was
especially tight on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives, where Christian
fundamentalists had camped to witness the end of the world, and at
the Old City's Temple Mount, with sites sacred to Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   On the last New Year's Eve of the Christian millennium,
observant Jews ushered in the sabbath, as they do every Friday, and
many went to pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site,
while 400,000 Muslims flocked to the al-Aqsa Mosque on Temple Mount
to mark the last Friday of prayer and fasting in the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, with new lighting on buildings, boulevards and bridges
over the Seine twinkling like the bonfires of a great Medieval
encampment, people packed the Champs-Elysees from the Tuileries to
the Arc de Triomphe as a digital clock at the Eiffel Tower counted
down _ overcoming an old-fashioned glitch that shut it down five
hours before midnight _ and announced the millennium in a burst of
20,000 electronic flashes.
</P>
<P>
   In London, 2 million people lined the Thames for a spectacular
fireworks show, as Queen Elizabeth, Prime Minister Tony Blair and
other dignitaries gathered under the 20-acre Millennium Dome, a
flying-saucer-like colossus at Longitude Zero in Greenwich, to mark
the transition while the bells of St. Paul's and Westminster and
churches across Britain pealed. Huge street parties were held in
hundreds of Britain's cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, floodlights, lasers and fireworks illuminated the
ancient pyramids at Giza and electronic music reverberated over the
desert as 50,000 people wined and dined in luxury tents and watched
a sparkling millennium show under the watchful eyes of police
officers on camels.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there were torchlight parades in the streets of
Stockholm; fireworks and singing by massed choirs in Reykjavik,
Iceland; concerts and a ball at the opera house in Tallinn,
Estonia; and a Millennium Ball at the Catherine Palace in St.
Petersburg, Russia.
